about:

I am a software developer with a passion for writing elegant and efficient [C++](https://isocpp.org/) code. My favourite piece of literature is [Effective C++](http://www.aristeia.com/books.html). 

I do my best to stay up to date with recent advancements by reading [blogs](https://isocpp.org/blog), watching [talks](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon) and listening to [podcasts](http://cppcast.com). 

Besides learning more about C++, improving my familiarity with [Python](https://www.python.org/) is of particular interest to me.

I have a girlfriend and a [dog](/img/avatar2.jpg). Together, we live in a small town just north of [Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg), Germany. When I'm not coding, its not uncommon to see me in a [climbing](http://www.climbing-factory.de) or [bouldering](http://cafekraft.de/) gym.

**I am currently looking for employment as a C++ developer. Please send me an <span class="pseudolink-email">email</span> if I managed to catch your interest.**
